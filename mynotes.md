# Matt's Terminal Window Working Notes

he's kind of dumb, but these help him remember the smart moments when he knew
how to do something (but only cause he looked it up).

## Terminal Notes

* ctrl-r let's you search history
    - you can keep hitting ctrl-r to go through the list
    - ctrl-g will put you back in a blank command line if you change your mind
* ctrl-a takes you to the start of a line
* ctrl-e takes you to the end of a line

## Vim Notes

* $ takes you to end of a line
* 0 takes you to the start of a line
* G goes to the start of a file
* gg goes to the end
    - 6gg takes you to line 6
* b goes to the start of the current word
* d is delete
* p is paste
* y is yank (in visual mode)
* you can double these up for an entire line.
    - yy yanks the line
    - dd deletes the line
* w means 'word'
    - dw deletes the from cursor position to end of current word
    - cw removes from the cursor to the end of the word and enters INSERT mode
    - guess what happens if you drop in and hit em with that bcw?
* in the above example c means 'change'
* sp <filename> opens the file in a split.
* you can use numbers with hjkl to move n number of spaces.
